# Express Lab
# My Dev Skills - Part 2
---

## Intro

In the last lesson you saw how to use HTML forms and Express middleware, such as:

- `express.urlencoded` (AKA body-parser middleware)
- `method-override`

to perform **Create**, **Update** & **Delete** data operations in an Express application.

This lab builds upon the `express-dev-skills` project you created in the _My Dev Skills - Part 1_ lab where the **Read** data operation was implemented.


## Exercises

The goal of the lab is to do put in a rep doing everything that you did during the _Express - Middleware_ lesson by adding the following functionality to the `express-dev-skills` project:

1. Display an _Add Skill_ link on the **index** view that when clicked, displays a **new** view that displays a form for entering a new Dev Skill.

2. When a new Dev Skill is submitted, the skill is added to the "database" and redirect the user to the **index** view.

## Bonuses

Add styling! Try out boostrap or materialize CSS.

### This lab is not a deliverable, however, Part 3, which builds upon this lab, is a deliverable.
