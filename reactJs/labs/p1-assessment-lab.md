# P1 Assessment Lab (optional)

If you miss the good old days of DOM, this lab is for you. It allows you the opportunity to reminisce, and perhaps compare and contrast the vanilla DOM manipulation way of making things happen visually versus the react way, at least for a small scale app.

## Task:

Recreate our Project 1 assessment, this time using your knowledge of react state, and how to deal with `<input>`s. It should work like this:

(However, feel free to style it to make it look better!)

# NOT A DELIVERABLE

This lab is not a deliverable.
