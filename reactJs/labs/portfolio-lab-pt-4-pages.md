# The React Portfolio Lab (Pt. 4: Adding Pages)

## Objective

Adding pages to a react website makes the user experience better, even though pages (client side routing with react router) are not really real html pages in a single page app. It's a little lie for the user to believe, so they can sleep well at night.

If you look at most portfolio pages, they all have some notion of pages. Here are the examples from Portfolio Lab 1. Note that all of these react-based portfolios use pages:

  - https://connorbanderson.com/ (source: reddit)
  - http://sebbeitel.dev/ (former student)
  - https://www.theelipan.com (source: reddit)
  - and of course, the one and only, https://aidanb.io/

## Task

1. Split up your portfolio into different "pages", eg., about, portfolio, whatever you prefer - and give each with a different URL.
2. For example, if you have an "about" link in the navbar, then when i click on it, i should see the URL change to "/about" and I should see the "About" information.
3. It should feel like a different page, BUT:
    - I should NOT be taken to a separate HTML page / see a page load. This should all still be part of your single page app
    - You must use client side routing with react router.

# OPTIONAL / NOT DELIV

This Lab is OPTIONAL and NOT a deliverable.
