# The React Portfolio Lab (Pt. 6: Blog or Forum)

# Purpose

The main purpose of this lab is to work our way uptowards doing full CRUD in P4. The objective is to create a "blog" (or "forum") section of your site. It should have index, show, and create functionality at the very least.

A secondary purpose of this lab is that a blog can actually be a very useful thing to have as a new developer:
  - You can showcase things you've just learned
  - Writing about things keeps you practicing
  - It gets your name out there
  - It's fun.
  - Even if it's not frequently updated, a blog shows that you are passionate and interested in your domain.
  - Also, if you do enough blog posts, you do tend to learn a lot about whatever you're writing about.

I strongly recommend you do the contact form lab (part 5) first though since that is a slightly easier lab, and also has slightly more detailed step by step instructions.

# Tasks

1. I want you to create a 'blog' link on your navbar, which will show "/blog" on the url bar thanks to client side routing with react router.
2. From this /blog address, I want to have access to some CRUD functionality:
  - Index: I should see a list of past blog entries
  - Create: Any visitor should be able to create a blog post (later when we learn authentication, you can fix this up)
  - Show: I should be able to click on an entry to see just that entry's details
3. (bonus) Update: I should be able to edit a blog post.
4. (bonus) Delete: I should be able to delete a blog post.
5. The site will be anonymous for now. No auth/login. So in theory, anyone can delete your posts, but one step at a time!
6. If you prefer to try a "forum" instead of a blog, feel free to do that instead!

# Deliverable

This Lab is a deliverable. I promise there will be way less next week.
