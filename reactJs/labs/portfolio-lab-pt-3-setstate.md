# The React Portfolio Lab (Pt. 3: SetState)

## Tasks

For this lab, you are to complete each of the following objectives at least once. You're welcome to express your creativity in meeting these requirements:

1. You must initialize some kind of state in your App.
2. You must access the state (ie., make it show up) somewhere in your App.
3. You must have a button or image or something clickable, somewhere on your page, that, when clicked, calls a function called `handleClick` (or something similar)
4. the `handleClick` (or whatever name) method must update your state using the setState method.
5. Some possible ideas:
    - Maybe you have a loading screen that keeps loading indefinitely until the 'skip intro' button is clicked. Clicking the 'skip' button sets a piece of state (isLoaded) to "true"
    - Maybe your website has a 'like' button, perhaps clicking on that 'like' button makes a 'like counter' go up?
    - Maybe you have some kind of e-commerce functionality like a shopping cart, and your user can click buttons to add things to their cart array held in state
    - Perhaps you have a 'login' button that changes the 'user' in state to be 
    - Perhaps you have a 'logout' button that changes the 'user' in state to be null or "".

# Deliverable

This Lab is a deliverable. You can either push this into a separate repo, or keep building on your prior parts, and push one final version.
