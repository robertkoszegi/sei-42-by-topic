# The React Portfolio (or Website!) Lab (Pt. 1: Components)

This is supposed to be a fun, ongoing React project, either a website, or e-commerce site, or blog, or portfolio, that you will keep adding on to. Approach this with the feeling that it is an experiment. You may even wind up getting a usable website (or portfolio) out of it, but that is not the point!

## Purpose of Series

The purpose of this series of labs is to have an ongoing React project to keep adding onto as we learn concepts. It is to be an experimental playground. 

Please do not spend a copious amount of time looking up designs, and making an AMAZING figma wireframe because you will fall behind, and the point of this lab is really just to give you a playground to practice react concepts.

For those of us who haven't got one, maybe it will provide a place to make lots of mistakes for when you put together a real portfolio.

Feel free to use this lab as a cover to do a site you've always wanted to do, or a fan page for somebody, or even a catcollector repeat. As long as you meet the requirements we ask for in each part, we're fairly relaxed about what the final result will  be.

## Purpose of Pt. 1

The purpose of part 1 of the react portfolio (or website) lab is to get you practicing defining components, and making them show up. Also to practice the whole flow of react web design, from wireframe, to breaking it up into components, to defining components.

# Tasks

1. Make a **wireframe** for your portfolio or website. **(15-20 minutes)**
    - You may use an easy-to-use tool like canva, or experiment with a more professional tool like Figma. You may consider making it mobile-first. Whatever you choose, please do not spend more than 30 minutes on this. If you do want to make a portfolio, I personally have found the following examples inspiring:
      - https://connorbanderson.com/ (source: reddit)
      - http://sebbeitel.dev/ (former student)
      - https://www.theelipan.com (source: reddit)
      - and of course, the one and only, https://aidanb.io/
2. **Break up the UI** into a component hierarchy, kind of like we've shown you in our in-class examples, with `<App>` being the topmost parent component. Examples:

3. Build a **static version** of your app using just presentational (function) components, and Use CSS to Lay it out. The idea is to have the layout match your component hierarchy, for example:
    - <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24878576/114315427-f4713d80-9acc-11eb-83e0-bb19232cac42.png">SEI Cafe</a>
    - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IBcCuxZ.png">Mastermind linked above</a>
4. (optional) Experiment a bit with props if you'd like.
5. (optional) convert some of your functional components into class (stateful) components if you'd like.

(Most of the steps above were "borrowed" from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html">React docs's recommended approach to building a react website</a>).
